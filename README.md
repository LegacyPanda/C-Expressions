# C-Expressions
Getting comfortable with C++ data types and expressions

Instructions:
Write a C++ application that complies with the following requirements:
1. Each monthâ€™s revenue must be stored in integer variables. You may hardcode the
   values into the program.

2. The name of each month must be stored as a constant string variable.

3. Calculate the average revenue for the year using a C++ expression and store the result
   in a double variable.

4. Create a const variable to store the conversion factor from rands to dollars.

5. Convert the average revenue from rands to dollars and store it in a double variable.

6. Output the monthly revenue table shown above in a user-friendly way.

7. Output the following below the table:
    a. Average revenue in rands.
    b. Average revenue in dollars.

In this project I will be learning all about git basics along with c++ data types and expressions.

All the code has multi compilation to prepare me for future projects that use this technique.
